## Theorem:
**The date with month m, day d, year $Y = 100c + y$ where $c ≥ 16$ and $0 ≤ y < 100$, has weekday number:** \

$w \equiv d+[(2.6)m-0.2]-2c+y+\lfloor{\frac{c}{4}}\rfloor+\lfloor{\frac{y}{4}}\rfloor(mod 7)$
\
**provided that March is taken as the first month of the year and January and February
are assumed to be the eleventh and twelfth months of the previous year.**
